    "\n",
    "With the Artificial Neural Networks becoming more and more popular and used across all domains, a common problem with designing an eficient one is the tuning of the so-called \"Hyperparameters\". \n",
    "\n",
    "An empirical aproach that addresses this problem is through manual trial and error. This aproach is (most of the time) inefficient and over the hand in almost all the possible ways.\n",
    "Another aproach is doing R&D (Research and Development) on other scientifical publications and finding problems simmilar to ours' that have been solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a third aproach, automating the process of tweaking the parameters using methods such as Evolutionary Algorithms to find the right Neural Network, fit for a specific domain problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of finding the right Evolutionary Algorithm was all trial and error, with each step documented. Based on some ad-hoc metrics, the algorithm could be brought to a state in which is better for the specific task that are performing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Genetic programming and Evolutionary Algorithms reffer to a technique of solving problems which solutions are in a wide space of possible solutions. Imagine a solution space which grows exponentially-proportional with the size of the input data. Classical deterministic algorithms will solve this kinds of problems, but the issue is that their time complexity is <b>exponetial</b>. So for large input sizes, it will not scale (in terms of time efficiency) on classical semiconductor machines."
