    "With the Artificial Neural Networks becoming more and more popular and used across all domains, a common problem with designing an eficient one is the tuning of the so-called \"Hyperparameters\". \n",
    "\n",
    "An empirical aproach that addresses this problem is through manual trial and error. This aproach is (most of the time) inefficient and over the hand in almost all the possible ways.\n",

    "\n",
    "The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a third aproach, automating the process of tweaking the parameters using methods such as Evolutionary Algorithms to find the right Neural Network, fit for a specific domain problem.\n",

    "<hr/>\n",
    "Genetic programming and Evolutionary Algorithms reffer to a technique of solving problems which solutions are in a wide space of possible solutions. Imagine a solution space which grows exponentially-proportional with the size of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[4] Classical deterministic algorithms are a possible solution to this. Any deterministic algorithm is presumed to do the transition between the current state and the following one in a predictible (or deterministic) manner.<br/>\n",
    "Deterministic algorithms will solve this kinds of problems, but the issue is that their time complexity is unreasonably high, or even <b>exponetialy</b>. So for large input sizes, these sort of algorithms will not scale (in terms of time or space efficiency) on conventional semiconductor machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For solving our problem, we will focus on intelligent algorhitms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic programming is a method of finding solution inspired from nature, more exactly from the real evolution. <br/>\n",

    "### [3] Components of Evolutionary Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    " In the following line we are going to describe the basic components which make up an EA.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Representation (how the individuals are encoded in our algorithm)\n",
    "* Fitness measurement method\n",
    "* Population\n",
    "* Parent selection strategy\n",
    "* Crossover \n",
    "* Mutation\n",
    "* Replacement mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Representation\n",
    "Usually the first step in implementing our EA is choosing a representation. We need to map or translate the objects in the real world space to our defined solution space. The terminology for the objects in the real world space is <b>phenotypes</b> and the one for the objects in our solution space (EA space) is <b>genotypes</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the following problem: Given an undirected graph, find the path with the most nodes. This problem is part of the NP-Complete problem class (which we are not going to prove now). The individual in our EA is the path (a sequence of linked nodes). The phenotype is the path itself. One genotype can be a binary number which has 1 on pozition j for j node is in sequence, 0 otherwise (even though this genotype doens't conside the order of the nodes, but this might not be a concern in our algorithm). Another genotype can be a simple list of ordered nodes.\n",
    "#### Fitness\n",
    "The role of the fitness function is to objectively measure how close is one individual to the desired solution. Based on this metric we can decide if one individual is fit enough to continue in our population or is not fit enought and needs to be replaced by better individuals (natural selection)\n",
    "#### Population\n",
    "The population is the set of individuals at some point (any point) in our EA. It can be seen as a set of genotypes of many generations. The genotypes themselfs is not evloving in any way, but the population is, through the creation of the new and more fit genotypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important metric here is the diversity of the population which measures how many different solution we have. \n",
    "To maintain diversity we need to give weaker genotypes a chance to reporoduce, because they might have valuable genetic material which combined with the right counterparty, might give us a fit individual. A population which is not diverse, tends to converge with the best fitness and might never give us a fit enough individual. Elitism in a EA (often chosing the best) can damage the diversity. This is the equivalent of a greedy algorithm which at each given step, it chooses only the local optimum.\n",
    "#### Parent selection\n",
    "The parent selection mechanism is the rule by which we allow individuals to bring offsprings into the population by combining their genes (becoming parents). In this part we get to choose parents, mosty based on their quality (fitness) but also based on some stochastic elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that we are introducing stochastic elements here, is that we want to avoid a homogenous population by giving the unfit individuals the chance to become parents so we can improve the diversity discuseed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Crossover\n",
    "The crossover operation has two genotypes as input and one or two offspring(s) as an output. By mergeing the genes of the input individuals, we are able to create the offspring which inherits traits from the parents and probabilistically has a higher fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the designing of our EA, it is crucial to choose a good crossover mechanism.\n",
    "#### Mutation\n",
    "Mutation naturally happenes in the real world. But in EAs are a method of keeping the population diverse. When is born through crossover, the genotype has a pre-defined chance to become mutated. It means that the features inherited from the parents are slightly changed.\n",
    "#### Replacement\n",
    "Replacement distinguishes individual based on their fitness and age (with stochastic influences). It is used to eliminate the individuals that haven't proved themselfs to have any value to the evolution process, or just the genotypes that are unfortunately chosen by the stochastic elements (which translates into environmental hazard).\n",
    "This is mostly one in the same step as the Parent selection part, when the individuals that are not selected for reproduction, are disposed from the populaiton."

To perform a crossover between the genotypes of the generation 4 would take an unreasonably huge amount of time.\n",
